Notes on Growing Kale

Kale is a delicious member of the brassica family. It is pretty easy to grow, all you need is a moderate soil pH (6.5-7.5), relatively even moistuire, and high nitrogen levels to promote vegetative growth. 

I recommed the dinosaur/lacinato kale varieties because they make the best kale salads (see recipes for more info). This variety exceeds in the Southern California climate. 

Growing Instructions

Obtain seeds. I like Johnny's seeds or Park seeds. 

Plant in seed starter soil 1/4-1/2 inch deep. Water thoroughly. Wait 5-7 days for seedlins to emerge. 

Provide plenty of light (via either direct sunlight or grow lights). 

After 4-6 weeks, seedlings should have at least two sets of true leaves (the leaves that come after the initial leaves which are called cotyledons).

Plant either in a planter box with regular potting soil or in the ground. Water frequently (kale likes to have even moisture until it is large). Pick kale at any time, but be sure it can keep growing (don't pick off all the leaves).
